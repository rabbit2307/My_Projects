# My_Projects

I created a machine learning model to classify stars, galaxies, and quasars using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, working entirely on my own as part of my personal exploration of astrophysics and data science. I cleaned the dataset, built new features like color differences between filters, and trained a Random Forest model to recognize the differences between these types of celestial objects. The model performed well, and I evaluated its results using precision, recall, and visual tools like confusion matrices and feature importance charts. Iâ€™m now planning to take this project further by testing other machine learning methods like support vector machines and neural networks, using dimensionality reduction to better understand how the data separates, adding photometric redshift estimates, and eventually turning it into an interactive web app using Streamlit.

As part of the extended analysis, I visualized the decision tree within the Random Forest to better understand how the model splits feature space. I also analyzed correlations among photometric features and engineered new color indices, which slightly improved classification performance. Additionally, I developed a custom prediction function that takes in user-specified values for some values and returns a prediction of whether the object is likely a star, galaxy, or quasar. This prepares the model for use in real-world applications or an interactive app.
